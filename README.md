# Syntrol [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HiceS/Syntrol.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HiceS/Syntrol)
API for robot emulation, just the foundation.

Will be built originally for .net to support the new ML.net libs.



## Docs

To generate docs you need to manually add the nuget package vsxmd

https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd

` dotnet add package Vsxmd -n ` -n is optionally no-restore

This does not work with travis for some reason

Docs should be accessible at https://hices.github.io/Syntrol/
